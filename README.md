# Collective Fate Linktree Clone

I was simply too cheap to pay for Linktree so I made one myself for my music project. 

Special thanks to Ania Kubow for her insightful YouTube tutorial, guiding me through the process of creating a Linktree clone. Check out her tutorial here: [Ania Kubow's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgt5efpmdM).
